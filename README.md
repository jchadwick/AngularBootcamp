In this session Jess Chadwick walks you through everything you need to know in order to begin developing AngularJS applications today.   Attendees will quickly move past the simplest of Hello World samples and right into how to solve real-world problems using battle-tested patterns and techniques. 

Though focusing on the current stable AngularJS release (1.x), the session will also speak to the new version of Angular 2 coming later this year to help make your transition to the new version as painless as possible.
